      "source": "\n\n**Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?**\n\nLasso Regression, short for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a regression technique that adds a penalty term to the regression coefficients during model training. This penalty is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, multiplied by a regularization parameter (lambda). Lasso Regression encourages sparsity in the coefficient estimates by shrinking some coefficients exactly to zero, effectively performing variable selection.\n\nThe main difference between Lasso Regression and other regression techniques, such as ordinary least squares (OLS) regression or Ridge Regression, lies in the type of penalty used. Lasso Regression uses an \\(l_1\\) penalty, while Ridge Regression uses an \\(l_2\\) penalty. This difference in penalties leads to different properties and behaviors of the resulting models.\n\n**Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?**\n\nThe main advantage of Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to automatically perform variable selection by setting some coefficients exactly to zero. This feature helps in identifying the most important predictors and discarding irrelevant ones, thereby simplifying the model and potentially improving its interpretability and generalization performance.\n\n**Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?**\n\nInterpreting the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model is similar to interpreting coefficients in other regression models. However, due to the \\(l_1\\) penalty in Lasso Regression, some coefficients may be exactly zero, indicating that the corresponding features have been eliminated from the model. The non-zero coefficients indicate the importance of the corresponding predictors in predicting the target variable.\n\n**Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the model's performance?**\n\nThe main tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is the regularization parameter (lambda), which controls the strength of the penalty applied to the coefficients. A larger value of lambda results in more shrinkage of the coefficients and more aggressive feature selection, while a smaller value of lambda allows for less shrinkage and more features to be retained in the model. The choice of lambda is typically determined using techniques such as cross-validation, where different values of lambda are tried, and the one that results in the best model performance (e.g., lowest validation error) is chosen.\n\n**Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?**\n\nLasso Regression, like other linear regression techniques, inherently models linear relationships between the predictors and the target variable. However, it can still be used for non-linear regression problems by incorporating non-linear transformations of the predictors into the model. For example, you can include polynomial features or apply transformations such as logarithmic or exponential transformations to the predictors before fitting the Lasso Regression model.\n\n**Q6. What is the difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression?**\n\nThe main difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression lies in the type of penalty used to regularize the regression coefficients. Ridge Regression uses an \\(l_2\\) penalty, which penalizes the sum of squared coefficients, while Lasso Regression uses an \\(l_1\\) penalty, which penalizes the sum of absolute values of the coefficients. As a result, Ridge Regression tends to shrink all coefficients towards zero but rarely sets them exactly to zero, while Lasso Regression can produce sparse models with some coefficients exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n\n**Q7. Can Lasso Regression handle multicollinearity in the input features? If yes, how?**\n\nYes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features by shrinking the coefficients of correlated features towards zero. This helps in stabilizing the coefficient estimates and mitigating the effects of multicollinearity on the model's performance. Additionally, by setting some coefficients exactly to zero, Lasso Regression effectively performs variable selection and eliminates redundant predictors, further alleviating the multicollinearity issue.\n\n**Q8. How do you choose the optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression?**\n\nThe optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression is typically chosen using techniques such as cross-validation. In cross-validation, the dataset is divided into training and validation sets multiple times, with different values of lambda tried in each iteration. The value of lambda that results in the best model performance, as evaluated on the validation set (e.g., lowest mean squared error or highest \\(R^2\\) score), is chosen as the optimal value. Regularization paths, which depict how the coefficients change with varying values of lambda, can also be examined to understand the trade-offs between model complexity and performance.",
