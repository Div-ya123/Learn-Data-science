This choice is made because nominal encoding assigns a single numerical value to each category without expanding the feature space, making it efficient for small categorical variables.\n\nQ5: **Nominal Encoding Calculation**\n- **Given:** 2 categorical columns with 5 unique values each.\n- **Calculation:** For each categorical column, a single additional column is created for nominal encoding. Therefore, 2 new columns would be created in total.\n\nQ6: **Encoding Technique for Animal Data**\n- **Choice:** For categorical data about animal species, habitat, and diet, a combination of nominal and ordinal encoding may be appropriate. Nominal encoding for unordered categories like species and habitat, while ordinal encoding can be used for ordered categories like diet types (e.g., herbivore, carnivore).\n\nQ7: **Encoding Technique for Customer Churn Prediction**\n- **Step-by-Step Implementation:** Here's how you can use encoding techniques for the given features:\n  - **Gender:** Nominal encoding (e.g., 0 for female, 1 for male).\n  - **Contract Type:** Nominal encoding (e.g., 0 for month-to-month, 1 for one year, 2 for two years).\n  - **Implementation:** In Python with Pandas,\n    ```python\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    # Sample dataset\n    data = {'Gender': ['Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male'],\n            'Contract': ['Month-to-Month', 'One year', 'Two year', 'Month-to-Month', 'Two year'],\n            'Monthly Charges': [50, 70, 90, 60, 80],\n            'Tenure': [12, 24, 36, 6, 48]}\n\n    df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n    # Nominal encoding for Gender and Contract\n    df['Gender'] = df['Gender'].map({'Male': 1, 'Female': 0})\n    df['Contract'] = df['Contract'].map({'Month-to-Month': 0, 'One year': 1, 'Two year': 2})\n\n    print(df)\n    ```\n  - This code converts categorical variables (Gender, Contract) into numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms while preserving the ordinal information in Contract type.",
