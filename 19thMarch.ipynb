      "source": "\n\nQ1: **Min-Max Scaling**\n- **What it is:** Min-Max scaling is a data preprocessing technique used to scale numerical features to a specific range, often between 0 and 1.\n- **How it works:** It transforms the feature values using the formula:\n  \\[ X_{\\text{scaled}} = \\frac{X - X_{\\text{min}}}{X_{\\text{max}} - X_{\\text{min}}} \\]\n  where \\( X \\) is the original feature value, \\( X_{\\text{min}} \\) is the minimum value in the feature, and \\( X_{\\text{max}} \\) is the maximum value in the feature.\n- **Example:**\n  ```python\n  from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n\n  data = [[1], [5], [10], [15], [20]]\n\n  scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(-1, 1))\n  scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)\n\n  print(scaled_data)\n  ```\n\nQ2: **Unit Vector Technique**\n- **What it is:** The Unit Vector technique in feature scaling normalizes feature vectors to have unit norm (length 1), focusing on the direction of the vectors rather than their magnitude.\n- **How it differs:** It differs from Min-Max scaling in that it normalizes the vectors based on their direction, ensuring they all have the same length (unit norm).\n- **Example:**\n  ```python\n  from sklearn.preprocessing import Normalizer\n  import numpy as np\n\n  data = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n\n  normalizer = Normalizer()\n  unit_vector_data = normalizer.fit_transform(data)\n\n  print(unit_vector_data)\n  ```\n\nQ3: **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**\n- **What it is:** PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the most important information.\n- **How it's used:** PCA identifies orthogonal (uncorrelated) principal components that capture the variance in the data, reducing dimensionality while retaining important features.\n- **Example:**\n  ```python\n  from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n\n  data = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n\n  pca = PCA(n_components=2)\n  transformed_data = pca.fit_transform(data)\n\n  print(transformed_data)\n  ```\n\nQ4: **Relationship between PCA and Feature Extraction**\n- **What it is:** PCA can be used for feature extraction by identifying the most important features (principal components) that explain the variance in the data.\n- **How it's used:** After PCA identifies principal components, these components can serve as new features in a reduced-dimensional space, capturing the essential information from the original features.\n- **Example:**\n  ```python\n  from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n\n  data = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n\n  pca = PCA(n_components=2)\n  transformed_data = pca.fit_transform(data)\n\n  print(transformed_data)\n  ```\n\nQ5: **Min-Max Scaling for a Food Delivery Recommendation System**\n- **How to use:** Apply Min-Max scaling to features like price, rating, and delivery time in the dataset to standardize their ranges for meaningful comparisons and analysis within the recommendation system.\n\nQ6: **PCA for Dimensionality Reduction in Stock Price Prediction**\n- **How to use:** Utilize PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset containing financial data and market trends, identifying principal components that explain the most variance and using them as new features for prediction.\n\nQ7: **Min-Max Scaling Example**\n- **Dataset:** \\([1, 5, 10, 15, 20]\\)\n- **Min-Max Scaling Formula:** \\[ X_{\\text{scaled}} = \\frac{X - X_{\\text{min}}}{X_{\\text{max}} - X_{\\text{min}}} \\]\n- **Scaled Values (Range -1 to 1):** \\([-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1]\\)\n\nQ8: **Feature Extraction using PCA Example**\n- **Dataset Features:** \\([height, weight, age, gender, blood pressure]\\)\n- **Process:** Perform PCA to identify principal components, then choose the number of components based on explained variance (e.g., retain enough components to explain 95% of variance).\n\nThese explanations provide a comprehensive understanding of each concept and how they are applied in real-world scenarios.",
