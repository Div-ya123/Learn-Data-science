Provide an example scenario where you would use each type of test.\n\n**Difference between t-test and z-test**:\n\n- **t-test**:\n  - Used when the sample size is small (typically n < 30).\n  - Used when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n  - Based on the t-distribution, which has heavier tails than the normal distribution.\n\n- **z-test**:\n  - Used when the sample size is large (typically n ≥ 30).\n  - Used when the population standard deviation is known.\n  - Based on the normal distribution (z-distribution).\n\n**Example scenarios**:\n- **t-test**: Suppose a small startup wants to know if their new employee training program is effective. They have a sample of 15 employees who went through the training, and they want to compare their performance scores to the company's historical average score.\n- **z-test**: A researcher wants to determine if a new drug has an effect on blood pressure. They have a large sample of 1000 patients and know the population standard deviation of blood pressure.\n\n### Q2: Differentiate between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.\n\n- **One-tailed test**:\n  - Tests for the possibility of an effect in one direction.\n  - Hypotheses are directional.\n  - Example: \\(H_0\\): \\(\\mu \\leq 10\\), \\(H_1\\): \\(\\mu > 10\\)\n\n- **Two-tailed test**:\n  - Tests for the possibility of an effect in both directions.\n  - Hypotheses are non-directional.\n  - Example: \\(H_0\\): \\(\\mu = 10\\), \\(H_1\\): \\(\\mu \\neq 10\\)\n\n### Q3: Explain the concept of Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing. Provide an example scenario for each type of error.\n\n- **Type 1 Error** (\\(\\alpha\\)):\n  - Incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.\n  - Example: A medical test indicates a patient has a disease when they actually do not (false positive).\n\n- **Type 2 Error** (\\(\\beta\\)):\n  - Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.\n  - Example: A medical test fails to detect a disease in a patient who actually has it (false negative).\n\n### Q4: Explain Bayes's theorem with an example.\n\n**Bayes's Theorem**:\n\\[\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\n\\]\n\n**Example**:\nSuppose a factory produces 1% defective items. If a test correctly identifies defective items 99% of the time (true positive rate) and correctly identifies non-defective items 99% of the time (true negative rate), what is the probability that an item is defective if the test indicates it is defective?\n\nLet:\n- \\(A\\) be the event that an item is defective.\n- \\(B\\) be the event that the test indicates the item is defective.\n\nGiven:\n- \\(P(A) = 0.01\\)\n- \\(P(B|A) = 0.99\\)\n- \\(P(B|\\neg A) = 0.01\\)\n- \\(P(\\neg A) = 0.99\\)\n\n\\[\nP(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\\neg A)P(\\neg A) = 0.99 \\times 0.01 + 0.01 \\times 0.99 = 0.0198\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \\frac{0.99 \\times 0.01}{0.0198} \\approx 0.50\n\\]\n\n### Q5: What is a confidence interval? How to calculate the confidence interval, explain with an example.\n\n**Confidence Interval**:\nA confidence interval (CI) is a range of values used to estimate the true value of a population parameter. It is associated with a confidence level that quantifies the level of confidence that the interval contains the parameter.\n\n**Calculation**:\n\\[\nCI = \\bar{x} \\pm t \\left(\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\n\\]\n\n**Example**:\nA sample of 30 students has an average test score of 70 with a standard deviation of 10. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean.\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\bar{x} = 70\\)\n- \\(s = 10\\)\n- \\(n = 30\\)\n- \\(t_{0.025, 29} \\approx 2.045\\)\n\nMargin of error:\n\\[\nME = t \\left(\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right) = 2.045 \\left(\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{30}}\\right) \\approx 3.73\n\\]\n\nConfidence interval:\n\\[\n70 \\pm 3.73 \\implies [66.27, 73.73]\n\\]\n\n### Q6. Use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of an event occurring given prior knowledge of the event's probability and new evidence. Provide a sample problem and solution.\n\n**Problem**:\nA test for a rare disease has a 99% sensitivity (true positive rate) and a 99% specificity (true negative rate). If 0.1% of the population has the disease, what is the probability that a person has the disease given a positive test result?\n\nLet:\n- \\(A\\) be the event that a person has the disease.\n- \\(B\\) be the event that the test is positive.\n\nGiven:\n- \\(P(A) = 0.001\\)\n- \\(P(B|A) = 0.99\\)\n- \\(P(B|\\neg A) = 0.01\\)\n- \\(P(\\neg A) = 0.999\\)\n\n\\[\nP(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\\neg A)P(\\neg A) = 0.99 \\times 0.001 + 0.01 \\times 0.999 = 0.01098\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \\frac{0.99 \\times 0.001}{0.01098} \\approx 0.0902\n\\]\n\n### Q7. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for a sample of data with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5. Interpret the results.\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\bar{x} = 50\\)\n- \\(s = 5\\)\n- \\(n = 30\\)\n- \\(t_{0.025, 29} \\approx 2.045\\)\n\nMargin of error:\n\\[\nME = t \\left(\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right) = 2.045 \\left(\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{30}}\\right) \\approx 1.87\n\\]\n\nConfidence interval:\n\\[\n50 \\pm 1.87 \\implies [48.13, 51.87]\n\\]\n\n**Interpretation**:\nWe are 95% confident that the true population mean lies between 48.13 and 51.87.\n\n### Q8. What is the margin of error in a confidence interval? How does sample size affect the margin of error? Provide an example of a scenario where a larger sample size would result in a smaller margin of error.\n\n**Margin of Error (ME)**:\nThe margin of error is the range added and subtracted from the sample mean to create the confidence interval. It reflects the extent of the expected sampling error.\n\n\\[\nME = t \\left(\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\n\\]\n\n**Effect of Sample Size**:\nAs the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases because the term \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) gets smaller.\n\n**Example**:\nConsider two surveys measuring the same population parameter:\n- Survey 1: \\(n = 50\\), \\(s = 5\\), \\(t_{0.025, 49} \\approx 2.0096\\)\n- Survey 2: \\(n = 200\\), \\(s = 5\\), \\(t_{0.025, 199} \\approx 1.972\\)\n\nMargin of error for Survey 1:\n\\[\nME_1 = 2.0096 \\left(\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{50}}\\right) \\approx 1.42\n\\]\n\nMargin of error for Survey 2:\n\\[\nME_2 = 1.972 \\left(\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{200}}\\right) \\approx 0.70\n\\]\n\n### Q9. Calculate the z-score for a data point with a value of 75, a population mean of 70, and a population standard deviation of 5. Interpret the results.\n\n**Z-score Calculation**:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{75 - 70}{5} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Interpretation**:\nA z-score of 1 indicates that the data point is 1 standard deviation above the mean.\n\n### Q10. In a study of the effectiveness of a new weight loss drug, a sample of 50 participants lost an average of 6 pounds with a standard deviation of 2.5 pounds. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the drug is significantly effective at a 95% confidence level using a t-test.\n\n**\n\nHypotheses**:\n- \\(H_0\\): \\(\\mu = 0\\) (no weight loss)\n- \\(H_1\\): \\(\\mu \\neq 0\\) (weight loss)\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\bar{x} = 6\\)\n- \\(s = 2.5\\)\n- \\(n = 50\\)\n\nt-statistic:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{s / \\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{6 - 0}{2.5 / \\sqrt{50}} \\approx 16.97\n\\]\n\nUsing a t-distribution with 49 degrees of freedom, the critical t-value for a two-tailed test at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) is approximately ±2.0096.\n\nSince 16.97 > 2.0096, we reject \\(H_0\\). There is significant evidence to support that the drug is effective.\n\n### Q11. In a survey of 500 people, 65% reported being satisfied with their current job. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of people who are satisfied with their job.\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\hat{p} = 0.65\\)\n- \\(n = 500\\)\n- \\(z_{0.025} = 1.96\\)\n\nStandard error:\n\\[\nSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.65 \\times 0.35}{500}} \\approx 0.021\n\\]\n\nMargin of error:\n\\[\nME = z \\times SE = 1.96 \\times 0.021 \\approx 0.041\n\\]\n\nConfidence interval:\n\\[\n0.65 \\pm 0.041 \\implies [0.609, 0.691]\n\\]\n\n### Q12. A researcher is testing the effectiveness of two different teaching methods on student performance. Sample A has a mean score of 85 with a standard deviation of 6, while sample B has a mean score of 82 with a standard deviation of 5. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the two teaching methods have a significant difference in student performance using a t-test with a significance level of 0.01.\n\n**Hypotheses**:\n- \\(H_0\\): \\(\\mu_1 = \\mu_2\\)\n- \\(H_1\\): \\(\\mu_1 \\neq \\mu_2\\)\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\bar{x}_1 = 85, s_1 = 6, n_1 = 30\\)\n- \\(\\bar{x}_2 = 82, s_2 = 5, n_2 = 40\\)\n\nPooled standard deviation:\n\\[\ns_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(29 \\times 36) + (39 \\times 25)}{68}} \\approx 5.46\n\\]\n\nt-statistic:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2}{s_p \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}} = \\frac{85 - 82}{5.46 \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{40}}} \\approx 2.27\n\\]\n\nUsing a t-distribution with 68 degrees of freedom, the critical t-value for a two-tailed test at \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) is approximately ±2.66.\n\nSince 2.27 < 2.66, we fail to reject \\(H_0\\). There is not enough evidence to support that the teaching methods have a significant difference in student performance.\n\n### Q13. A population has a mean of 60 and a standard deviation of 8. A sample of 50 observations has a mean of 65. Calculate the 90% confidence interval for the true population mean.\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\bar{x} = 65\\)\n- \\(\\sigma = 8\\)\n- \\(n = 50\\)\n- \\(z_{0.05} = 1.645\\)\n\nStandard error:\n\\[\nSE = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{50}} \\approx 1.13\n\\]\n\nMargin of error:\n\\[\nME = z \\times SE = 1.645 \\times 1.13 \\approx 1.86\n\\]\n\nConfidence interval:\n\\[\n65 \\pm 1.86 \\implies [63.14, 66.86]\n\\]\n\n### Q14. In a study of the effects of caffeine on reaction time, a sample of 30 participants had an average reaction time of 0.25 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.05 seconds. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time at a 90% confidence level using a t-test.\n\n**Hypotheses**:\n- \\(H_0\\): \\(\\mu = \\text{population reaction time}\\)\n- \\(H_1\\): \\(\\mu \\neq \\text{population reaction time}\\)\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\bar{x} = 0.25\\)\n- \\(s = 0.05\\)\n- \\(n = 30\\)\n- \\(t_{0.05, 29} \\approx 1.699\\)\n\nt-statistic:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{s / \\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{0.25 - \\mu}{0.05 / \\sqrt{30}} \\approx t\n\\]\n\nDepending on \\(\\mu\\), compare the t-statistic with the critical value to determine significance. If the calculated t-value is greater than 1.699, reject \\(H_0\\).",
