      "source": "\n\nQ1: **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**\n- **Calculation:** Suppose we have the following data for students' study time (hours) and their final exam scores (out of 100):\n  ```\n  Study Time: [5, 8, 7, 6, 4]\n  Exam Scores: [80, 90, 85, 75, 70]\n  ```\n  Using the formula for Pearson correlation:\n  \\[ r = \\frac{n(\\sum{XY}) - (\\sum{X})(\\sum{Y})}{\\sqrt{[n\\sum{X^2} - (\\sum{X})^2][n\\sum{Y^2} - (\\sum{Y})^2]}} \\]\n  Plug in the values and calculate to get the Pearson correlation coefficient (r).\n- **Interpretation:** If \\( r > 0 \\), it indicates a positive correlation, meaning as study time increases, exam scores tend to increase. If \\( r < 0 \\), it indicates a negative correlation, implying that more study time is associated with lower exam scores.\n\nQ2: **Spearman's Rank Correlation**\n- **Calculation:** Suppose we have the following data for sleep hours and job satisfaction levels:\n  ```\n  Sleep Hours: [7, 8, 6, 9, 5]\n  Job Satisfaction: [8, 7, 9, 6, 5]\n  ```\n  Convert the data into ranks and then calculate Spearman's rank correlation using the formula:\n  \\[ \\rho = 1 - \\frac{6\\sum{d_i^2}}{n(n^2 - 1)} \\]\n  where \\( d_i \\) is the difference between the ranks of corresponding pairs.\n- **Interpretation:** A Spearman's rank correlation close to 1 indicates a strong monotonic relationship, meaning as sleep hours increase, job satisfaction tends to increase.\n\nQ3: **Comparing Pearson and Spearman Correlation**\n- **Calculation:** Compute both Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and Spearman's rank correlation (ρ) for the given data on exercise hours and BMI for 50 participants.\n- **Interpretation:** If both coefficients are similar (e.g., both positive and relatively close to 1), it indicates a strong linear relationship between exercise hours and BMI. If Spearman's ρ is higher than Pearson's r, it suggests a non-linear relationship that Spearman's rank correlation captures better.\n\nQ4: **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**\n- **Calculation:** For example, let's say we have data for TV hours and physical activity levels for 50 participants. Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient (r) using the formula.\n- **Interpretation:** A positive \\( r \\) suggests a positive linear relationship (more TV time, less physical activity or vice versa), while a negative \\( r \\) implies an inverse relationship.\n\nQ5: **Age and Soft Drink Preference**\n- The provided data seems incomplete or not suitable for correlation analysis. Please provide the complete dataset or clarify the format.\n\nQ6: **Pearson Correlation Coefficient for Sales Calls and Sales**\n- **Calculation:** Let's say we have data for sales calls per day and sales made per week for 30 sales representatives. Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient (r) using the formula.\n- **Interpretation:** A positive \\( r \\) indicates a positive linear relationship (more sales calls, more sales made), while a negative \\( r \\) implies an inverse relationship.\n\nFor the calculations, you can use Python libraries like NumPy or pandas to compute correlation coefficients efficiently.",
